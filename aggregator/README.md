# Aggregator

Aggregator is a set of Java applications to flatten and enhance basketball statistics from a relational database populated by the accumulator applications.

It is composed of four main components:

* [aggregator-teamBoxScore](https://github.com/pablote3/basketball-java/tree/master/aggregator/aggregator-teamBoxScore) stores game data from each teams perspective

* [aggregator-officialBoxScore](https://github.com/pablote3/basketball-java/tree/master/aggregator/aggregator-officialBoxScore) stores game data from each officials perspective

* [aggregator-playerBoxScore](https://github.com/pablote3/basketball-java/tree/master/aggregator/aggregator-playerBoxScore) stores game data from each players perspective

* [aggregator-standing](https://github.com/pablote3/basketball-java/tree/master/aggregator/aggregator-standing) stores standings data for each team every day during the season

* [aggregator-services](https://github.com/pablote3/basketball-java/tree/master/aggregator/aggregator-services) provides sharable Spring components


## Getting Started

These instructions will get a local instance of the project up and running for development and testing.

## Installation

* Clone or download [basketball repository](https://github.com/pablote3/basketball-java)

* Import aggregator project into favorite IDE.

## Running Unit Tests

Run all JUnit tests in the whole project.

There are two types of tests that will be executed: 

* Unit tests are defined in test projects test processor logic and run against mock data.

* Spring Batch automatically runs the jobs defined in the configuration files using the test resources.  

Data input into these tests are based off successful completion of [accumulator system tests](https://github.com/pablote3/basketball-java/tree/master/accumulator).  

Results need to be confirmed manually by checking .csv extract files generated by the applications.

* TeamBoxScoreTests extract file teamBoxScore.csv should contain 8 entries from games played on 10/27/2016

* StandingTests extract file standings.csv should contain 30 entries from all teams on 10/27/2016

## Running System Tests

System tests require MySQL database to persist data and file system to supply JSON input files.

Install MySQL on Linux based system using command

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server
    
Copy testSystem folder to directory on local file system
   
    https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByBsbTluZmwKa3NFTENYcWlDSDQ

Create database schema using mysql command

    mysql -u root -p CREATE SCHEMA `accumulate_test` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    
Load database by running mysql command from testSystem directory

    mysql -u root -p accumulate_test < accumulate_systemTest_20161026.sql

Update main/resources/service.properties

    xmlstats.fileBoxScore: append "~/pdrive/pwork/basketball-java/accumulator" with location of testSystem fileBoxScore directory
    
    xmlStats.fileRoster: append "~/pdrive/pwork/basketball-java/accumulator" with location of testSystem fileRoster directory
    
    xmlstats.fileStandings: append "~/pdrive/pwork/basketball-java/accumulator" with location of testSystem fileStandings directory
    
Package application by running command from accumulator directory

    mvn package
    
Launch system tests by running command from project target directory
    
    java -DgameDate="2016-10-27" -DgameTeam="" -jar accumulator-scoreGame.jar
